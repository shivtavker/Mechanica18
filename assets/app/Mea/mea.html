            Mechanical Engineering is one of the major activities in the engineering profession and 
            its principles are involved in the design, study, development and construction of nearly 
            all of the physical devices and systems. Continued research and development have led to 
            better machines and processes helping the mankind.

            The Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Madras is as old as the Institute itself. 
            Its impact on the Institute and on society is easily demonstrated by noting the alignment of 
            the department's evolution with key events and technological advances in the India and elsewhere. 
            Today, the department of mechanical engineering of IIT Madras attracts and features an extraordinary 
            rich diversity and quantity of talented individuals, with nearly 700 undergraduates, 
            500 graduate students and over 60 faculty members. The impressive array of 
            students makes the department as the largest in the country and one of the largest in Asia.
        </p>

            Outside of teaching undergraduate and graduate students, the faculty of Mechanical 
            Engineering actively pursues research through graduate students. The current graduate 
            students include nearly 150 Master of Technology students (M.Tech), 100 Master of 
            Science (by research) students (M.S.) and 220 students pursuing their 
            doctoral programme (Ph.D)
